# persona_helper

This is the source code for the [Persona Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/persona-helper/mhojpjjecjmdbbooonpglohcedhnjkho?hl=en) Chrome Extension. This allows users of CAIRIS to add factoids based on online resources.  These can be used as the basis for specifying persona characteristics in CAIRIS.  

To use, simply:

* highlight text on a web page that forms the basis of the factoid.
* Click on the extension button.  You will be asked to specify a factoid summarising the evidence highlighted
* Clicking on 'Ok' will add a new *Document Reference* to CAIRIS representing the factoid.
* Right click on the extension button to change the CAIRIS URL, author, or contributor settings

Notes when using this extension:

* The extension relies on the 'test' session that comes with default CAIRIS installation.  Later versions will support authentication with CAIRIS, so only legitimate users can add factoids
